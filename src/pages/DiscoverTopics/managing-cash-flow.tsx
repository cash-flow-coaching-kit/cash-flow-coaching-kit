							Setting the right price for your products and services will help

						<Typography component="h3" variant="h5">
							Volume
						</Typography>
						<Typography
							variant="body1"
							component="p"

							Increasing the range or number of products and services,

							can increase the volume of your sales to generate greater income.

						</Typography>
						<Typography

							Collecting payments from your customers as quickly as possible
							will allow you to use the cash within your business. Establish
							clear credit policies and carry out credit checks before setting
							up accounts. Carefully consider the account terms you offer your
							customers and maintain regular communication to ensure they comply
							with these terms. Consider discounts for early payment.

						<Typography component="h3" variant="h5">
							Assets
						</Typography>
						<Typography
							variant="body1"
							component="p"
							className={styles.contentText}

							Under-utilised or unnecessary assets tie up cash that could be put

						<Typography

							Think about where you are spending money. Identify which costs are

							Consider whether there are some expenses that can be reduced to
							improve your cash flow. Take advantage of credit arrangements and

							Maintaining the right levels of the right inventory plays an
							important part in managing your cash flow. Forecast your
							customers’ needs and buy and ship inventory as close to the time
							of sale as possible. Identify, discount and/or return slow moving
							stock to free up cash and shelf-space.

							Staff costs are significant expenses for many businesses. In
							addition to the weekly payroll, there are costs associated with
							hiring, training and rewarding staff. Choosing the right staff for
							your business and reducing staff turnover can assist in managing
							these costs. Rostering the right number of staff to cover demand
							is vital to producing your income and preventing unnecessary
							costs.
